#  ComprasUSA

This project is the solution to a code challenge I had during my MBA graduation. 

Please check the [remastered version project](https://github.com/MarcosApostolo/ComprasUSACaseStudy) that I use to practice iOS skills.

Please note that a few decisions on this project were simply to follow the code challenge requirements, such as naming it with my name. On the new version I don't follow these standards.
